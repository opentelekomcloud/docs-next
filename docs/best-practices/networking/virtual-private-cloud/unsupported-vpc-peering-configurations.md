# Unsupported VPC Peering Configurations

## Scenarios

The VPC peering connection configurations are not supported in table below:

| Scenario                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| VPC peering connections cannot enable ECSs in their VPCs to share an EIP to access the Internet.

**Table 1** Scenarios that VPC peering connections are invalid

## Notes and Constraints

- If the ECSs in VPCs connected by a VPC peering connections are in
    different security groups, you need to add rules to the security
    groups to allow access to each other. For details, [Enabling ECSs in
    Different Security Groups to Communicate with Each Other Through an
    Internal
    Network](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/virtual-private-cloud/umn/access_control/security_group/security_group_configuration_examples.html#en-us-topic-0081124350).

    :::note
    In all examples in this section, the ECSs in local and peer VPCs are
    in the same security group. No additional security group rule is
    required.
    :::

- Each route table of a VPC can have a maximum of 200 routes. If you
    want to establish VPC peering connections between multiple VPCs,
    consider this restriction when planning networking.

- In a VPC route table, the route priority is as follows:

  - Local route: A route that is automatically added by the system
        for communication within a VPC. It has a higher priority than a
        custom route.

  - Custom route: A route added by a user. It uses the longest
        prefix match rule to find a destination for packet forwarding.

## Invalid VPC Peering for Overlapping VPC CIDR Blocks

If two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks, the VPC peering connection may
not take effect due to route conflicts. The following describes the
reasons and configuration suggestions.

- VPCs with the same CIDR block also include subnets that overlap.

    VPC peering connections are not usable. As shown in
    **Table 2**, VPC-A and
    VPC-B, and their subnets have the same CIDR block. If you create a
    VPC peering connection between VPC-A and VPC-B, their route tables
    are shown in **Table 2**.

    In the rtb-VPC-A route table, the custom route for routing traffic
    from VPC-A to VPC-B and the local route have overlapping
    destinations. The local route has a higher priority and traffic will
    be forwarded within VPC-A and cannot reach VPC-B.

    **Table 2** VPC route table details

    If two VPCs want to use their IPv6 CIDR blocks for communication by
    a VPC peering connection but the IPv4 CIDR blocks of the VPCs or
    subnets overlap, the connection is not usable.

    ![**Figure 2** Networking diagram
    (IPv6)](https://arch-assets-dev.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/static/img/docs/best-practices/networking/virtual-private-cloud/en-us_image_0000001209300412.png)

    Two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks but some of their subnets do
    not overlap. VPC peering connections will not take effect in the following
    scenarios:

  - Connecting overlapping CIDR blocks of VPCs

        As shown in Figure 3,
        if you create a VPC peering connection between VPC-A and VPC-B,
        the VPC peering connection will not take effect because the two
        VPCs have the same CIDR block.

  - Connecting overlapping subnets from different VPCs

        If you create a VPC peering connection between Subnet-A01 and
        Subnet-B02, the route tables are shown in table below. In the
        rtb-VPC-B route table, the custom route for routing traffic from
        Subnet-B02 to Subnet-A01 and the local route have overlapping
        destinations. The local route has a higher priority and traffic
        will be forwarded within Subnet-B02 and cannot reach Subnet-A01.

        ![**Figure 3** Networking diagram

        **Table 3** VPC route table details

    If the subnets connected by a VPC peering connection do not overlap,
    the connection will take effect. As shown in Figure 4, you can create a
    VPC peering connection between Subnet-A02 and Subnet-B02. In this
    case, the routes do not conflict and the VPC peering connection
    takes effect.

    ![**Figure 4** Networking diagram
    (IPv4)](https://arch-assets-dev.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/static/img/docs/best-practices/networking/virtual-private-cloud/en-us_image_0000001209321492.png)

    If two VPCs want to use their IPv6 CIDR blocks for communication by
    a VPC peering connection but the IPv4 CIDR blocks of the VPCs or
    subnets overlap, the connection is not usable.

## Invalid VPC Peering for Sharing an EIP

As shown in Figure 6, although
VPC-A and VPC-B are peered and ECS-A01 in VPC-A has an EIP, ECS-B01 in
VPC-B cannot access the Internet using the EIP bound to ECS-A01.
