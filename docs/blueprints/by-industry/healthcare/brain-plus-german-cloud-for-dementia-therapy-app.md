# Open Telekom Cloud for Dementia Therapy App

To meet the strict guidelines for the German digital health market, the team from [Brain+](#about-brain) wanted to provide the backend for its app from a German cloud, and Brain+ chose the Open Telekom Cloud. In addition to that, with a growing focus on the UK market, Open Telekom Cloud can provide a framework allowing the team to scale to the UK and later to the rest of Europe.
