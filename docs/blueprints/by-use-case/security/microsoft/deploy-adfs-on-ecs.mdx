# Deploy Active Directory Federation Services on ECS

In this guide, we'll walk you through deploying Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS) on ECS. We'll cover everything from installing Active Directory Domain Services & Active Directory Certificate Services, preparing SSL certificates, configuring DNS zones till installing and configuring an AD FS farm.

:::warning disclaimer
Deploying Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), and Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) all on a single Windows server is supported for proof-of-concept or lab environments but is not recommended for production. Co-locating these roles can lead to:

* **Resource Contention**: Directory replication, certificate issuance and federation token processing all compete for CPU, memory and I/O, potentially degrading performance.
* **Security Boundaries**: A compromise of one service (e.g. the CA) could expose your entire identity infrastructure—isolating roles on dedicated VMs or hardened physical hosts reduces blast radius.
* **Patch and Maintenance Complexity**: Windows updates or configuration changes for one role may inadvertently impact the others, complicating change windows and downtime planning.

For resilient, secure operations, follow Microsoft's [best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs) by placing AD DS, AD CS and AD FS on separate servers, enforce strict network segmentation, and implement a robust backup and DR strategy.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the deployment, make sure you have control over a publicly registered domain name. This is required for configuring a public endpoint for AD FS and enabling secure communication over HTTPS.

For the rest of this blueprint we are going to assume:

* **Public Domain**: `example.com`
* **Private Domain**: `mycompany.com`

## Creating an ECS Server

Go to *Open Telekom Cloud Console* -> *Elastic Cloud Server* and click *Create ECS Server*. Choose :

  * **Flavor**: "*General-purpose s7n.large.2*"
  * **Image**: *Public Image* -> "*Windows*" -> "*Enterprise_Windows_Server_2025_STD_amd64_bios_latest*"
  * **Security Group**: Add the following **Inbound Rules** to a new Security Group (or amend an existing one):
    - `TCP/80`, `TCP/443`
    - `TCP/3389 ` 
  * **EIP**: Click on "*Auto assign*"

Complete the wizard and deploy the ECS instance. Once the deployment completes, return the *Elastic Cloud Server*, enter your ECS instance 
and click *More* -> *Get Password*. Click *Select File* to select the Key Pair you used during the installation and click *Get Password* in order 
to get the credentials for the local Administrator account.

* Make sure you save the Key Pair (a `.pem` file) after its creation in your working station.
* Getting the password will not be available for the first 3-5min after the creation of the instance.

## Creating a Public DNS Endpoint

When integrating AD FS as an Identity Provider (IdP) within your Open Telekom Cloud tenant—it is essential that the Elastic IP (EIP) assigned to your ECS Server 
resolves to a valid and secure FQDN. This means the public DNS entry must point to the EIP and be backed by a properly issued TLS certificate.

Without this, the Open Telekom Cloud platform will not accept the IdP registration due to trust and validation requirements. 
Ensuring your AD FS endpoint is accessible over a recognized, secure URL is not just best practice—it's a prerequisite for federation scenarios with OTC's IAM services.

To enable full DNS-based automation and allow for secure domain validation—especially when configuring AD FS as an Identity Provider—you need to delegate domain management to Open Telekom Cloud's Domain Name Service (DNS). This requires transferring authority over your domain's NS (Name Server) records to OTC.

Start by logging into your domain registrar's control panel and ensure the following:

1. Disable any dynamic DNS features associated with the domain or subdomains that will be used by AD FS endpoints.
2. Update the NS records of your domain to point exclusively to the following OTC name servers. 

  ```
  ns1.open-telekom-cloud.com
  ns2.open-telekom-cloud.com
  ```

Once the nameserver change propagates and OTC has authoritative control over your domain, you're ready to define DNS zones and records. 
Create a Public DNS Zone in the Open Telekom Cloud DNS service, then define an **A record** that maps your AD FS public domain (e.g., `adfs.example.com`) to the EIP you've already assigned to your ECS Server.

## Installing Active Directory Domain Services

### Installing the Server Roles

1. Open *Server Manager* → *Add roles and features*.
2. Select "*Role-based or feature-based installation*" and choose the ECS Server from the *Server Pool*.
3. Under *Server Roles*, check "*Active Directory Domain Services*" and "*DNS Server*"
4. Click *Next* through the wizard, confirm installation selections and click *Install*.

or run as Administrator the following Powershell command:

```Powershell
Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services, DNS -IncludeManagementTools
```

### Promoting ECS Server to Domain Controller

Once the ADDS role installation completes, the *Post-Deployment Configuration* link appears in *Server Manager* -> *Tasks*:

1. Click *Promote this server to a domain controller*.
2. Choose *Add a new forest* and enter `mycompany.com` as domain name .
3. Specify a *Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM)* password.
4. Accept *NETBIOS domain name* as is and **disable** (if it's enabled) the *Create DNS delegation* option.
4. Accept default locations for the database, log files and SYSVOL.
5. Review prerequisites, then click *Install*. The server will reboot when promotion finishes.

Alternatively, use PowerShell:

```PowerShell
$secPwd = ConvertTo-SecureString "ThisIsNotASecurePassword!" -AsPlainText -Force
Install-ADDSForest `
  -DomainName "mycompany.com" `
  -CreateDNSDelegation:$false `
  -DatabasePath "C:\Windows\NTDS" `
  -DomainMode "WinThreshold" `
  -ForestMode "WinThreshold" `
  -InstallDNS:$true `
  -LogPath "C:\Windows\NTDS" `
  -SysvolPath "C:\Windows\SYSVOL" `
  -SafeModeAdministratorPassword $secPwd `
  -Force
```

:::warning
Be sure to substitute every occurrence of `ThisIsNotASecurePassword!` with a strong, organization-approved password.
:::

### Creating Organization Unit, Users & Groups

Before mapping roles in AD FS and Open Telekom Cloud, we need first to define our administrative scopes by provisioning a new Organization Unit (OU), 
two security groups,`Tenant-Admins` and `ECS-Admins`, and then create one user per group. 

1. Open *Server Manager* -> *Tools* -> *Active Directory Users and Computers*, right-click on **mycompany.com** -> *New* -> *Organization Unit*.
    Enter as name, the name of your Open Telekom Cloud Tenant and enable *"Protect container from accidental deletion"* and click *OK*.
2. Right-click the newly created OU -> *New* -> *Group*.
    - **Group name**: `Tenant-Admins`
    - **Group scope**: *"Global"*
    - **Group type**: *"Security"*

    Repeat to create `ECS-Admins`.
3. Right-click the newly created OU -> *New* -> *User*. Create a new user (e.g. Erika Mustermann, merika@mycompany.com) and assign them to group **Tenant-Admins**.
4. Right-click the newly created OU -> *New* -> *User*. Create a new user (e.g. Max Mustermann, mmax@mycompany.com) and assign them to group **ECS-Admins**.

![image](/img/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/security/microsoft/Screenshot_from_2025-04-22_14-38-59.png)

or altenative run as Administrator the following PowerShell commands:

```PowerShell
# Define base DN for the OTC OU in the mycompany.com domain
$otcOu = "OU=OTC0000001XXXXX,DC=mycompany,DC=com"
# Create groups
New-ADGroup -Name "Tenant-Admins" -GroupScope Global -GroupCategory Security -Path $otcOu
New-ADGroup -Name "ECS-Admins"    -GroupScope Global -GroupCategory Security -Path $otcOu
# Create users
New-ADUser -Name "Erika Mustermann" -SamAccountName merika `
  -UserPrincipalName merika@mycompany.com `
  -Path $otcOu `
  -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "ThisIsNotASecurePassword!" -AsPlainText -Force) `
  -Enabled $true
New-ADUser -Name "Max Mustermann" -SamAccountName mmax `
  -UserPrincipalName mmax@mycompany.com `
  -Path $otcOu `
  -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "ThisIsNotASecurePassword!" -AsPlainText -Force) `
  -Enabled $true
# Add users to groups
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Tenant-Admins" -Members merika
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "ECS-Admins"    -Members mmax
```

:::warning
Be sure to substitute every occurrence of `ThisIsNotASecurePassword!` with a strong, organization-approved password.
:::

## Configuring a DNS Zone

1. Go to *Server Manager* -> *Tools* -> *DNS*.
2. Expand the tree and right-click *Forward Lookup Zones* -> *New Zone* and click *Next*.
3. Choose *"Primary Zone"* as **Zone Type** and click *Next*.
4. Choose *"To all DNS servers running on domain controllers in this domain: mycompany.com"* as **Active Directory Zone Replication Scope** and click *Next*.
5. Enter `example.com` as **Zone Name** and click *Next* and *Finish*.

Once the zone is created, right-click on it and then click on *New Host (A or AAAA)*. Fill in the following values for the A record and click *OK*:
* **Host**: `adfs`
* **IP address**: The private IP address of the ECS Server assigned by the VPC DHCP server.

## Installing Active Directory Certificate Services

Before AD FS can issue and consume the SSL/TLS & token-signing certificates it needs, 
we must setup an Enterprise Certificate Authority on the ECS domain controller.

1. Open *Server Manager*, click *Add roles and features*.
2. Choose *"Role-based or feature-based installation"*, and select the ECS Server from the *Server Pool*.
3. Under *Server Roles*, check *"Active Directory Certificate Services"*.
4. When prompted to select *AD CS/Role Services*, include the "*Certification Authority*".
5. Click *Next* through the wizard and then *Install*.

or alternatively via PowerShell:

```PowerShell
Install-WindowsFeature AD-Certificate -IncludeManagementTools
```

Once the Active Directory Certificate Services are installed, Open *Server Manager* → *Tasks* and click the link *Configure Active Directory Services*

![image](/img/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/security/microsoft/Screenshot_from_2025-04-21_12-29-18.png)

Follow the wizard steps and set the following values:

1. **Credentials**: `MYCOMPANY\Administrator`, click *Next*
2. **Select Role Services to configure**: select *"Certification Authority"* and click *Next*
3. **Specify the setup type of the CA**: select *"Enterprise CA"* and click *Next*
4. **Specify the type of the CA**: select *"Root CA"* and click *Next*
5. **Specify the type of the private key**: select *"Create a new private key"* and click *Next*
6. **Specify the cryptographic options**: select *"RSA#Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider"* with `2048` length and hash algorithm `SHA256`, click *Next*
7. Click *Next* for the rest of the wizard steps and finally *Configure*

## Installing Active Directory Federation Services

### Creating Certificate

First, we need to create a Certificate Template:

1. Go to *Server Manager* -> *Tools* -> *Certificate Authority*.
2. Expand the tree of the local authority, right-click on *Certificate Templates* and then click on *Manage* and the *Certificate Templates Console* will open.
3. Find the template *Web Server* in the list, right-click on it and then click on *Duplicate Template*.
4. Fill in the following information:
    * Tab **General**: 
      - **Template display name**: `ADFS SSL`.
      - **Template name**: `ADFS SSL`.
      - **Publish certificate in Active Directory**: Enable this option.
    * Tab **Request Handling**: 
      - **Allow private key to be exported**: Enable this option.
    * Tab **Security**: 
      - Add `Authenticated Users` in the *Group or user names* list and assign them `Read` and `Enroll` permissions.
      - Add `Domain Computers` in the *Group or user names* list and assign them `Read` and `Enroll` permissions.

### Registering SPN

When you configure Windows Integrated Authentication against your ADFS endpoint, the client will request a Kerberos ticket for the SPN **HTTP/adfs.mycompany.com.**. The Active Directory Key Distribution Center (KDC) must locate that SPN on the correct service account in order to encrypt the ticket with the matching key. If the SPN is missing or bound to the wrong account, Kerberos authentication cannot proceed—clients will either fall back to NTLM or enter a `401` challenge loop. To prevent this, we need to register the SPN explicitly on your AD FS service account in order to ensure that KDC can issue a valid Kerberos ticket and your Windows Integrated Auth flow succeeds.

**Run as Administrator** the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
setspn -s http/adfs.mycompany.com administrator
```

### Disabling Extended Protection Token Check

:::warning
When you integrate AD FS with most cloud-based IAM or SSO front-ends, you're typically introducing one or more TLS-terminating proxies or load-balancers. Those intermediaries break the Channel-Binding Token (CBT) exchange that Extended Protection relies on, so AD FS sees no binding data and rejects the request.

Disabling Extended Protection is almost always needed when you're fronting AD FS with a cloud-based TLS terminator that doesn't forward the original channel-binding info. Once you have an end-to-end TLS path (or move to non-CBT-based auth), you can safely turn it back on.
:::

**Run as Administrator** the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ADFSProperties -ExtendedProtectionTokenCheck None
```

### Enabling AD FS Sign-On Page

By default (in Microsoft Server 2016 and later) the sign-on page is off, so trying to browse to: `https://adfs.example.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx` will yield a `404` error.

**Run as Administrator** the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-AdfsProperties -EnableIdpInitiatedSignonPage $true
```

## Verification

Open the address `https://adfs.example.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx`, in an incognito or private browsing session using your preferred browser,
and:

1. Confirm that the SSL certificate is properly installed and trusted.  
2. Verify the login page loads without errors and that the “Sign in” button is displayed.
