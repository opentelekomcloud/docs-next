# Sovereignty

The Sovereignty blueprints demonstrate how to design and deploy cloud architectures and applications on Open Telekom Cloud that give you complete authority over data, operations and underlying technology. Leveraging Open Telekom Cloudâ€™s exclusively european data centers and its OpenStack-based foundation, each blueprint shows how to:

* Localize all compute and storage resources in GDPR-compliant EU regions, guaranteeing precise control over data residency
* Employ customer-managed encryption keys and confidential-computing enclaves to secure data at rest and in transit without vendor-held backdoors
* Leverage OpenStack APIs and Kubernetes-based container orchestration for fully portable workloads, consistent deployment pipelines and frictionless migration options

Following our reference blueprints, organizations can confidently meet GDPR, GAIA-X and industry-specific mandates, avoid vendor lock-in and sustain control over every layer of their environment while taking advantage of the performance, scalability and availability of a leading European cloud platform as Open Telekom Cloud.
