# Sovereignty

The Sovereignty blueprints demonstrate how to design and deploy cloud architectures and applications on Open Telekom Cloud that give you complete authority over data, operations and underlying technology.

Following our reference blueprints, organizations can confidently meet GDPR, GAIA-X and industry-specific mandates, avoid vendor lock-in and sustain control over every layer of their environment while taking advantage of the performance, scalability and availability of a leading European cloud platform as Open Telekom Cloud.
