# Introduction to Nextcloud

[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is an open-source collaboration and file-sharing platform that organizations can deploy on-premises or in a private cloud. It combines secure file storage and synchronization with integrated groupware calendar, contacts and email, so teams can manage documents and communications from a single, self-hosted environment. By retaining full control over infrastructure and data location, Nextcloud helps maintain privacy, security and regulatory compliance.

## Features

- **[Nextcloud Files](https://nextcloud.com/files/)**: Offers seamless file sharing and synchronization across devices, ensuring that users always have access to their latest documents.
- **[Nextcloud Office](https://nextcloud.com/office/)**: Provides an integrated office suite that allows real-time collaborative editing of documents.
- **[Nextcloud Talk](https://nextcloud.com/talk/)**: Facilitates secure video calls, chat, and web conferences, ensuring that communication remains private and compliant with data security standards.
- **[Nextcloud Groupware](https://nextcloud.com/groupware/)**: Offers easy-to-use web mail, calendaring, and contacts that help your team get things done quicker and easier, integrated with Nextcloud Files.

## Benefits

By deploying Nextcloud on-premises, organizations maintain complete control over their data—an essential requirement for meeting European mandates like the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) (GDPR). The platform’s comprehensive security toolkit, which includes both server-side and end-to-end encryption alongside flexible identity and access management, helps guard against unauthorized access and breaches. At the same time, Nextcloud’s modular, scalable architecture lets businesses expand capacity, integrate new services and fine-tune performance as their needs evolve, delivering an adaptable solution that remains cost-efficient over time.

## Data and Tech Sovereignty

Data and technology sovereignty is non-negotiable for European organizations: it guarantees exclusive authority over data, prevents vendor lock-in and ensures compliance with regional regulations by keeping sensitive information under local jurisdiction. As digital services evolve, retaining full control of both data and infrastructure has become critical—relying on non-European providers can introduce legal uncertainties and expose assets to foreign authorities.

In the current digital and political environment, the importance of cloud and tech sovereignty has grown significantly. For European companies, retaining control over their data and technology infrastructure is vital. Relying on non-European cloud solutions can lead to potential conflicts with local data protection laws and expose sensitive data to foreign authorities.

Deploying Nextcloud on the Open Telekom Cloud aligns businesses with stringent European data-security mandates while delivering a scalable, high-performance cloud platform.

Throughout this series, we’ll guide you through implementing a highly available Nextcloud deployment using Open Telekom Cloud services.
