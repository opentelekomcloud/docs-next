# Introduction to Nextcloud

## Why Should One Use Nextcloud?

[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is a comprehensive open-source platform for collaboration and file sharing, making it an excellent choice for both companies and offices. It provides a secure, self-hosted environment for storing and sharing files, managing contacts, calendars, emails, and much more. This platform is particularly useful for organizations that prioritize data privacy, control, and compliance.

## Features of Nextcloud

- **[Nextcloud Files](https://nextcloud.com/files/)**: Offers seamless file sharing and synchronization across devices, ensuring that users always have access to their latest documents.
- **[Nextcloud Office](https://nextcloud.com/office/)**: Provides an integrated office suite that allows real-time collaborative editing of documents.
- **[Nextcloud Talk](https://nextcloud.com/talk/)**: Facilitates secure video calls, chat, and web conferences, ensuring that communication remains private and compliant with data security standards.
- **[Nextcloud Groupware](https://nextcloud.com/groupware/)**: Offers easy-to-use web mail, calendaring, and contacts that help your team get things done quicker and easier, integrated with Nextcloud Files.

## Benefits for Companies and Offices

- **Data Sovereignty**: Hosting Nextcloud on their own servers ensures full control over their data, which is crucial for compliance with European regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).
- **Enhanced Security**: Nextcloud is built with robust security features, including encryption and identity management, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Flexibility**: The platform's scalability allows it to grow with the organization, providing a cost-efficient solution that adapts to changing needs.

## Data and Tech Sovereignty

For European organizations, data sovereignty is essential. It ensures that they:
- Maintain control over their data ownership and control.
- Operate independently without the risk of vendor lock-in.
- Meet compliance requirements, safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access or transfer.

In the current digital environment, the importance of cloud and tech sovereignty has grown significantly. For European companies, retaining control over their data and technology infrastructure is vital. Relying on non-European cloud solutions can lead to potential conflicts with local data protection laws and expose sensitive data to foreign authorities. By hosting Nextcloud on the Open Telekom Cloud, companies can ensure compliance with stringent European data security standards while benefiting from powerful cloud infrastructure.

## Licensing Information

Nextcloud is distributed under the [AGPLv3](https://nextcloud.com/licenses/) license, which requires users who modify and use the software in a network to release their modifications under the same license.

## Deployment on the Open Telekom Cloud

In the following articles, we are going to build a highly available Nextcloud setup using services provided by the Open Telekom Cloud.
