Many enterprises choose to build their own Kubernetes clusters. However, the O&M workload of on-premises clusters is heavy, and O&M personnel need to configure the management systems and monitoring solutions by themselves. For enterprises, managing a large number of images requires high O&M, labor, and management costs, and the efficiency is low. SoftWare Repository for Container (SWR) manages container images that function on multiple architectures, such as Linux and Arm. Enterprises can migrate their image repositories to SWR to reduce costs.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-178/docs/best-practices/containers/software-repository/migrating-container-images"}],"unlisted":false}}')}}]);
