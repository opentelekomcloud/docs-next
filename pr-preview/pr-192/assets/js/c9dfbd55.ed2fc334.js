The best thing: Computing-intensive algorithms are processed in freely programmable circuits, so-called Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). These are hardware cards that can be individually programmed depending on the intended use. In this way, they process tasks within a server considerably faster than standard hardware and thus considerably accelerate applications.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-192/docs/blueprints/by-industry/innovation/xelera-open-telekom-cloud"}],"unlisted":false}}')}}]);
