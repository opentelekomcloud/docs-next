However, this mechanism cannot reflect the real-time resource usage when traffic bursts arrive, because the collected CPU and memory usage data lags behind the actual load balancer traffic metrics. For some services (such as flash sale and social media) that require fast auto scaling, scaling based on this rule may not be performed in a timely manner and cannot meet these services\' actual needs. In this case, auto scaling based on ELB QPS data can respond to service requirements more timely.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-250/docs/best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/auto-scaling-based-on-elb-monitoring-metrics"},{"id":"blueprints/by-use-case/devops/ci-jenkins-swr-cce","title":"Build a CI Pipeline with Jenkins, SWR and CCE","description":"This blueprint covers integrating Jenkins with Open Telekom Cloud Container Engine (CCE) for efficient CI/CD pipelines.

Many enterprises choose to build their own Kubernetes clusters. However, the O&M workload of on-premises clusters is heavy, and O&M personnel need to configure the management systems and monitoring solutions by themselves. For enterprises, managing a large number of images requires high O&M, labor, and management costs, and the efficiency is low. SoftWare Repository for Container (SWR) manages container images that function on multiple architectures, such as Linux and Arm. Enterprises can migrate their image repositories to SWR to reduce costs.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-250/docs/best-practices/containers/software-repository/migrating-container-images"},{"id":"best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/updating-resources","title":"Updating Resources Accordingly","description":"Updating Images","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-250/docs/best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/updating-resources"}],"unlisted":false}}')}}]);
