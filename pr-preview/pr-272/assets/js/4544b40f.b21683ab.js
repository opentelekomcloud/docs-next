A second opinion from the Open Telekom Cloud saves radiologists time, improves the quality of their diagnoses and reduces costs. The Hamburg-based entrepreneurs founded their start-up in 2015 and developed artificial intelligence that can detect indications of cancer \u2013 such as carcinomas \u2013 on MRI scan and assess whether a tumor is benign or malignant. And that doesn\u2019t just save doctors time. \u201cThe biggest advantage is the improved quality of a diagnosis,\u201d says Maximilian Waschka, one of the four Fuse-AI founders. \u201cOur algorithm helps radiologists notice abnormalities on thousands of images more reliably.\u201d The start-up estimates that its e-health solution can save health insurers at least 10 percent of the costs associated with MRI examinations.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-272/docs/blueprints/by-industry/healthcare/fuse-ai-open-telekom-cloud"},{"id":"blueprints/by-industry/healthcare/brain-plus-german-cloud-for-dementia-therapy-app","title":"Open Telekom Cloud for Dementia Therapy App","description":"To meet the strict guidelines for the German digital health market, the team from Brain+ wanted to provide the backend for its app from a German cloud, and Brain+ chose the Open Telekom Cloud.
