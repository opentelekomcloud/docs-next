To enhance the read and write performance of your client for connecting to the instance, you can use your client to read different data copies. You need to connect to replica set instances using HA connection addresses. You can also configure read/write splitting. Otherwise, the high availability and high read performance of replica set instances cannot be guaranteed.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-276/docs/best-practices/databases/document-database-service/how-do-replica-sets-achieve-high-availability-and-readwrite-splitting"},{"id":"best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/migrating-from-other_clouds-to-cce","title":"Migrating Clusters from Other Clouds to CCE","description":"Assume that you have deployed the WordPress on 3rd party cloud provider and created your own blog; this document will drive you through how to smoothly migrate an application from a managed Kubernetes cluster on that provider to a Open Telekom Cloud CCE in six easy steps without interrupting the service.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-276/docs/best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/migrating-from-other_clouds-to-cce"},{"id":"best-practices/containers/software-repository/migrating-container-images","title":"Migrating Container Images","description":"Containers are growing in popularity. Many enterprises choose to build their own Kubernetes clusters. However, the O&M workload of on-premises clusters is heavy, and O&M personnel need to configure the management systems and monitoring solutions by themselves. For enterprises, managing a large number of images requires high O&M, labor, and management costs, and the efficiency is low. SoftWare Repository for Container (SWR) manages container images that function on multiple architectures, such as Linux and Arm. Enterprises can migrate their image repositories to SWR to reduce costs.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-276/docs/best-practices/containers/software-repository/migrating-container-images"},{"id":"best-practices/application-services/distributed-message-service/migrating-kafka-services","title":"Migrating Kafka Services","description":"This solution will demonstrate how you can migrate Kafka services to connect message producers and consumers to a new Kafka instance and can even migrate persisted message data to a new Kafka instance.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-276/docs/best-practices/application-services/distributed-message-service/migrating-kafka-services"},{"id":"best-practices/computing/image-management-service/migrating-service-data-across-accounts-data-disks","title":"Migrating Service Data Across Accounts (Data Disks)","description":"Generally, service data is stored on data disks.
