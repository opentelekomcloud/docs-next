It automates the creation, update, and deletion of DNS records based on the state of resources within the cluster. ExternalDNS is typically employed in scenarios where you need to expose services running inside a Kubernetes cluster to the outside world with fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), ensuring they are accessible by external users.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-279/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/networking/create-a-public-dns-endpoint-with-externaldns"},{"id":"blueprints/by-use-case/security/keycloak/cce-keycloak","title":"Deploy Keycloak on CCE","description":"In this blueprint, we are going to discuss the steps to install Keycloak, in Open Telekom Cloud, on a CCE Cluster.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-279/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/security/keycloak/cce-keycloak"},{"id":"best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/prepare-cce-for-external-workloads","title":"Prepare CCE to Expose Workloads","description":"Before deploying our workloads, the CCE cluster must be equipped with a set of foundational components.
