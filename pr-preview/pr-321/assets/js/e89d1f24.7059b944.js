This setup allows you to securely access resources within the VPC from your local environment as if they were part of your private network, without exposing them on the public internet.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-321/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/networking/establish-a-p2s-vpn-connection-with-a-vpc"},{"id":"blueprints/by-use-case/networking/establish-a-p2s-vpn-connection-with-a-vpc-tf-ansible","title":"Establish a Point-to-Site VPN Connection between your Development Machine and a VPC using Terraform and Ansible","description":"Engineers access sites from almost anywhere, earning the nickname road warriors. In order to make sure, access is as secure as possible, VPNs are a good choice. The goal of this blueprint is to deliver an easy way to setup, configure and manage an OpenVPN Server and its users. The OpenVPN Server will push a default route to its clients to make sure all traffic is routed through the VPN.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-321/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/networking/establish-a-p2s-vpn-connection-with-a-vpc-tf-ansible"},{"id":"blueprints/by-use-case/networking/establish-a-site-to-site-vpn-from-open-telekom-cloud-to-aws-using-enterprise-router-and-bgp-routing","title":"Establish a Site-to-Site VPN from Open Telekom Cloud to AWS using Enterprise Router and BGP Routing","description":"This article shows the process of establishing a Site-to-Site Virtual Private Network (VPN) between Open Telekom Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) using BGP routing for dynamic and efficient network connectivity.
