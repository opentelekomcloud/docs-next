It covers the end-to-end setup for forwarding logs from CCE nodes and containers to a centralized Loki instance, enabling efficient querying, visualization, and troubleshooting through Grafana dashboards. The goal is to provide a consistent and scalable logging approach for Kubernetes environments running on Open Telekom Cloud.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-327/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/observability/aggregate-cce-logs-with-fluentbit-and-grafana-loki"},{"id":"blueprints/by-use-case/observability/aggregate-cce-logs-with-promtail-and-grafana-loki","title":"Aggregate CCE Logs with Promtail & Grafana Loki","description":"This blueprint explains how to collect and centralize logs from Cloud Container Engine (CCE) using Promtail and Grafana Loki. It outlines the process of configuring Promtail as a log forwarder within Kubernetes and integrating it with Grafana Loki for efficient storage and visualization. By the end, you will have a unified and scalable logging setup that simplifies monitoring, troubleshooting, and operational insights across your CCE workloads.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-327/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/observability/aggregate-cce-logs-with-promtail-and-grafana-loki"},{"id":"blueprints/by-use-case/observability/deploy-grafana-loki-on-cce","title":"Deploy Grafana Loki on CCE","description":"Deploying Grafana Loki on Cloud Container Engine (CCE) enables a scalable, cloud-native log aggregation and monitoring solution within the Open Telekom Cloud environment. Loki integrates seamlessly with Grafana to collect, index, and visualize log data without the high storage costs associated with traditional log management systems. By running Loki on CCE, users can take advantage of Kubernetes-native deployments, simplified scaling, and secure, managed infrastructure. This approach provides an efficient foundation for observability, supporting modern DevOps practices and improving operational insights across distributed applications.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-327/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/observability/deploy-grafana-loki-on-cce"}],"unlisted":false}}')}}]);
