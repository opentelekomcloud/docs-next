To enhance the read and write performance of your client for connecting to the instance, you can use your client to read different data copies. You need to connect to replica set instances using HA connection addresses. You can also configure read/write splitting. Otherwise, the high availability and high read performance of replica set instances cannot be guaranteed.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-335/docs/best-practices/databases/document-database-service/how-do-replica-sets-achieve-high-availability-and-readwrite-splitting"},{"id":"best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/migrating-from-other_clouds-to-cce","title":"Migrating Clusters from Other Clouds to CCE","description":"This best practices series showcase how to migrate Kubernetes workloads from other cloud or on-premises Kubernetes environments to the Cloud Container Engine (CCE) on Open Telekom Cloud. It highlights the key considerations for moving applications, container images, and persistent data while ensuring compatibility and service continuity. This best practice focuses on leveraging Open Telekom Cloud services such as OBS and SWR, along with established tools like Velero, and optionaly MinIO, to provide a reliable and structured migration path for Kubernetes workloads.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-335/docs/best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/migrating-from-other_clouds-to-cce"},{"id":"best-practices/containers/software-repository/migrating-container-images","title":"Migrating Container Images","description":"Containers are growing in popularity. Many enterprises choose to build their own Kubernetes clusters. However, the O&M workload of on-premises clusters is heavy, and O&M personnel need to configure the management systems and monitoring solutions by themselves. For enterprises, managing a large number of images requires high O&M, labor, and management costs, and the efficiency is low. SoftWare Repository for Container (SWR) manages container images that function on multiple architectures, such as Linux and Arm. Enterprises can migrate their image repositories to SWR to reduce costs.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-335/docs/best-practices/containers/software-repository/migrating-container-images"},{"id":"blueprints/by-use-case/observability/migrate-from-promtail-to-grafana-alloy","title":"Migrating from Promtail to Grafana Alloy","description":"With Promtail reaching end-of-life on March 2, 2026, migrating to Grafana Alloy is essential for maintaining a supported and future-proof logging infrastructure.
