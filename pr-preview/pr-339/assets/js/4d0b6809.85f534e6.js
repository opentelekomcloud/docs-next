Loki integrates seamlessly with Grafana to collect, index, and visualize log data without the high storage costs associated with traditional log management systems. By running Loki on CCE, users can take advantage of Kubernetes-native deployments, simplified scaling, and secure, managed infrastructure. This approach provides an efficient foundation for observability, supporting modern DevOps practices and improving operational insights across distributed applications.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-339/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/observability/deploy-grafana-loki-on-cce"},{"id":"blueprints/by-use-case/observability/migrate-from-promtail-to-grafana-alloy","title":"Migrating from Promtail to Grafana Alloy","description":"With Promtail reaching end-of-life on March 2, 2026, migrating to Grafana Alloy is essential for maintaining a supported and future-proof logging infrastructure.
