In this way, IAM prevents these accounts from sharing your password or access key with other users. IAM also ensures user account security and reduces security risks for your enterprise information by allowing you to set login verification policies, password policies, and an access control list (ACL).","keywords":["iam"],"slug":"/best-practices/security-services/iam","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-341/docs/best-practices/security-services/iam","sidebar":"bestPracticesSidebar","navigation":{"previous":{"title":"Restoring Backup Data","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-341/docs/best-practices/security-services/host-security-service/using-hss-and-cbr-to-defend-against-ransomware/defense-measures/restoring-backup-data"},"next":{"title":"Recommendations for Using IAM","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-341/docs/best-practices/security-services/iam/recommendations-for-using-iam"}}}}')}}]);
