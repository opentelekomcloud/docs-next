The setup uses Docker Swarm for container orchestration and Traefik as the ingress controller, combined with an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for TLS termination and secure external access. The architecture runs on multiple Elastic Cloud Servers (ECS) in a high-availability configuration, with a bastion host for administrative access and a NAT gateway for outbound connectivity.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-360/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/devops/dokploy/dokploy"},{"id":"blueprints/by-use-case/devops/dokploy/configure-dokploy-for-otc","title":"Configure Dokploy for Open Telekom Cloud","description":"This part of the blueprint explains how to configure Dokploy for use with Open Telekom Cloud. After deploying Dokploy, you need to integrate it with cloud services and external components to make the platform fully operational. The configuration steps covered in this guide include setting up container registries, defining S3-compatible storage destinations, assigning a server domain, updating the web server IP address, and connecting to a Git provider. Each of these steps ensures that Dokploy can interact seamlessly with Open Telekom Cloud resources and external systems, enabling you to build and manage applications efficiently.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-360/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/devops/dokploy/configure-dokploy-for-otc"},{"id":"blueprints/by-use-case/devops/dokploy/deploy-applications-with-dokploy","title":"Deploy Applications with Dokploy","description":"The final part of this blueprint describes how to deploy highly available user workloads with Dokploy on Open Telekom Cloud, positioning it as an open-source alternative to platforms such as Vercel, Netlify, Azure App Services and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-360/docs/blueprints/by-use-case/devops/dokploy/deploy-applications-with-dokploy"},{"id":"blueprints/by-use-case/devops/dokploy/deploy-dokploy-on-ecs","title":"Deploy Dokploy on ECS","description":"The first part of the blueprint explains how to deploy a highly available Dokploy platform on a fleet of Elastic Cloud Servers (ECS).
