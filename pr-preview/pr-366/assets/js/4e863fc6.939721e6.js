However, this mechanism cannot reflect the real-time resource usage when traffic bursts arrive, because the collected CPU and memory usage data lags behind the actual load balancer traffic metrics. For some services (such as flash sale and social media) that require fast auto scaling, scaling based on this rule may not be performed in a timely manner and cannot meet these services\' actual needs. In this case, auto scaling based on ELB QPS data can respond to service requirements more timely.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-366/docs/best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/auto-scaling-based-on-elb-monitoring-metrics/"},{"id":"best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/auto-scaling-based-on-elb-monitoring-metrics/auto-scaling-based-on-elb-monitoring-metrics-with-keda","title":"Auto Scaling Based on ELB Monitoring Metrics with KEDA","description":"This article demonstrates how to implement auto scaling using KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling) with ELB monitoring metrics.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-366/docs/best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/auto-scaling-based-on-elb-monitoring-metrics/auto-scaling-based-on-elb-monitoring-metrics-with-keda"},{"id":"best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/auto-scaling-based-on-elb-monitoring-metrics/auto-scaling-based-on-elb-monitoring-metrics-with-prometheus-adapter","title":"Auto Scaling Based on ELB Monitoring Metrics with Prometheus Adapter","description":"This article explains how to implement auto scaling with the Prometheus Adapter using ELB monitoring metrics, allowing the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to use custom metrics sourced from Prometheus.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-366/docs/best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/auto-scaling-based-on-elb-monitoring-metrics/auto-scaling-based-on-elb-monitoring-metrics-with-prometheus-adapter"},{"id":"best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/automate-dns-records-creation-from-cce-ingresses-with-externaldns","title":"Automate DNS Records Creation from CCE Ingresses with ExternalDNS","description":"ExternalDNS is a Kubernetes component used to manage DNS records for services and applications running in a Kubernetes cluster. It automates the creation, update, and deletion of DNS records based on the state of resources within the cluster. ExternalDNS is typically employed in scenarios where you need to expose services running inside a Kubernetes cluster to the outside world with fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), ensuring they are accessible by external users.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-366/docs/best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/automate-dns-records-creation-from-cce-ingresses-with-externaldns"},{"id":"best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/enabling-external-traffic-with-ingress-and-tls","title":"Enabling External Traffic with Ingress & TLS","description":"Before deploying our workloads, the CCE cluster must be equipped with a set of foundational components. In this section, we\'ll install and configure essential prerequisites such as the NGINX Ingress Controller for routing external traffic, cert-manager for managing TLS certificates, and other supporting workloads. These components establish the baseline infrastructure required to expose services securely and ensure smooth operation of the application stack within the Kubernetes environment.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-366/docs/best-practices/containers/cloud-container-engine/enabling-external-traffic-with-ingress-and-tls"},{"id":"best-practices/networking/elastic-load-balancing/routing-traffic-to-backend-servers-in-different-vpcs-from-the-load-balancer","title":"Routing Traffic to Backend Servers in Different VPCs from the Load Balancer","description":"You can use ELB to route traffic to backend servers in two VPCs connected over a VPC peering connection.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-366/docs/best-practices/networking/elastic-load-balancing/routing-traffic-to-backend-servers-in-different-vpcs-from-the-load-balancer"},{"id":"best-practices/networking/elastic-load-balancing/routing-traffic-to-backend-servers-in-the-same-vpc-as-the-load-balancer","title":"Routing Traffic to Backend Servers in the Same VPC as the Load Balancer","description":"You can route traffic to backend servers in the VPC where the load balancer is running.","permalink":"/docs-next/pr-preview/pr-366/docs/best-practices/networking/elastic-load-balancing/routing-traffic-to-backend-servers-in-the-same-vpc-as-the-load-balancer"},{"id":"best-practices/networking/elastic-load-balancing/using-advanced-forwarding-for-application-iteration","title":"Using Advanced Forwarding for Application Iteration","description":"As the business grows, you may need to upgrade your application.
